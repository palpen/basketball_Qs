Questions to answer using NBA data

1. What makes a player a "streaky" shooter? (high variance in points scored / FG% in a season, FG% over a given time period in a quarter given min. number of attempts) Who are the "streaky" shooters in the NBA? (e.g. people who fall above the 90th percentile in variance of points / FG% in a season)
2. How does a player affect the distribution of shots taken -- by location/distance, pull-up vs. spot-up, distance from nearest defender? (Offensive efficiency is a function of these variables and others, including fast break opportunities, offensive rebounds and fouls drawn) 
3. What player and lineup characteristics are correlated with adjusted (regularized) plus-minus? (is there some way to devise a basketball lineup/team production function?)
